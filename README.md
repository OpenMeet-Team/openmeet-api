# About OpenMeet

OpenMeet is an open-source platform designed to help people organize and connect, whether it's for grassroots movements, community building, or event management. The platform 
focuses on privacy, decentralization, and empowering users to take control of their data and interactions.

## What You Can Do with OpenMeet

We anticipate two main use cases:
## Developing Features and Navigating the Code

OpenMeet is built with extensibility in mind, making it easy for developers to contribute and customize:

- **Feature Development**: Add new features through our modular architecture
- **Customization**: Adapt the platform for different community types and needs
- **API Integration**: Connect with external tools via our comprehensive API
- **Testing**: 
  - Run unit tests: `npm run test`
  - Run e2e tests: `npm run test:e2e`
  - View coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

All contributions should include appropriate test coverage. Check our testing guide for more details.

Deploy and manage your own OpenMeet instance with these key features:

- **Quick Setup**: Simple deployment using Docker or cloud services
- **Community Management**: Create and manage multiple communities with custom settings
- **Event Tools**: Organize virtual and in-person events effortlessly
