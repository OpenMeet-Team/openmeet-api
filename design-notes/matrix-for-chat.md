   - Read receipts will indicate when messages have been seen

2. **Rich Media Support**
   - Improved image and file sharing with previews
   - Better rendering of links and embeds
   - Support for formatted text (bold, italic, code blocks)

3. **Chat Organization**
   - Clearer distinction between group chats and event chats
   - Improved notification settings per chat room
   - Better thread support for organized conversations

4. **Mobile Experience**
   - More responsive interface on mobile devices
   - Offline message queue for spotty connections
   - Reduced data usage for mobile networks

5. **Accessibility**
   - Improved keyboard navigation
   - Better screen reader support
   - Customizable text sizing and contrast

### User Flow Examples

**Group Chat Flow:**
1. User navigates to a group page
2. Chat panel loads with recent messages
3. New messages appear in real-time with sender avatars and timestamps
4. User can type messages, share files, and use formatting options
5. Notifications appear for mentions and messages in other rooms

**Event Chat Flow:**
1. User joins an event page
2. Event chat loads with context-specific information
3. Event notifications (start time, updates) appear in the chat
4. Participants can communicate before, during, and after the event
5. Event-specific resources can be shared in the chat

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Architecture Changes

1. **Backend Components**
   - Replace Zulip service with Matrix service in the NestJS backend
   - Implement Matrix client SDK for server-side operations
   - Create mapping between OpenMeet entities and Matrix rooms/users

2. **Data Model Updates**
   - Add Matrix-specific fields to User entity (matrixUserId, accessToken)
   - Update ChatRoom entity to store Matrix room IDs
   - Create mapping tables for Matrix events if needed

3. **API Layer Changes**
   - Update chat endpoints to interact with Matrix instead of Zulip
   - Add new endpoints for Matrix-specific features
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible

4. **Frontend Updates**
   - Integrate Matrix client SDK in the frontend
   - Update chat components to use Matrix events
   - Implement real-time updates using Matrix sync API

### Matrix Integration Details

1. **User Management**
   - Create Matrix users for each OpenMeet user
   - Map OpenMeet authentication to Matrix authentication
   - Handle user profile synchronization

2. **Room Management**
   - Create Matrix rooms for OpenMeet groups and events
   - Set appropriate room permissions based on OpenMeet roles
   - Handle room membership changes when group/event membership changes

3. **Message Handling**
   - Send/receive messages through Matrix API
   - Handle message formatting and rich content
   - Implement message editing and deletion

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Use Matrix sync API for real-time message delivery
   - Implement efficient sync handling to minimize resource usage
   - Handle reconnection and state recovery
   - Maintain per-user syncing clients with automatic cleanup

5. **Media Management**
   - Use Matrix media repository for file uploads
   - Handle image resizing and thumbnails
   - Implement media caching for performance

### Migration Strategy (Hard Cutover)

1. **Pre-Cutover Preparation**
   - Complete development of Matrix integration
   - Thoroughly test all functionality in staging environment
   - Prepare database migration scripts to add Matrix fields
   - Create admin tools for provisioning Matrix users and rooms

2. **Cutover Process**
   - Schedule maintenance window for the transition
   - Disable access to the platform during cutover
   - Run database migrations to add Matrix-specific fields
   - Provision Matrix users for all existing OpenMeet users
   - Create Matrix rooms for all existing groups and events
   - Deploy updated backend with Matrix integration
   - Deploy updated frontend with Matrix client
   - Enable access to the platform

3. **Post-Cutover Support**
   - Provide clear communication to users about the new chat system
   - Offer documentation on new features
   - Monitor system closely for issues
   - Have support team ready to address user questions
   - Maintain ability to quickly roll back if critical issues arise

4. **Zulip Decommissioning**
   - Once Matrix integration is confirmed stable, decommission Zulip
   - Archive Zulip data for compliance purposes
   - Remove Zulip-related code and dependencies

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Authentication**
   - Challenge: Securely managing Matrix access tokens
   - Solution: Store encrypted tokens in database, implement token refresh

2. **Performance**
   - Challenge: Handling Matrix sync for many concurrent users
   - Solution: Implement user-specific Matrix client instances with lifecycle management
     - Start dedicated client instance when a user accesses chat
     - Register event callbacks for real-time updates
     - Client remains active during user session
     - Automatic cleanup of inactive clients after period of inactivity (2 hours)
     - Resource-efficient connection pooling for admin operations

3. **Scalability**
   - Challenge: Scaling Matrix as user base grows
   - Solution: Configure Matrix server for horizontal scaling, implement caching

4. **Data Consistency**
   - Challenge: Keeping OpenMeet and Matrix data in sync
   - Solution: Implement transaction-based operations, retry mechanisms

5. **Error Handling**
   - Challenge: Graceful handling of Matrix service disruptions
   - Solution: Implement circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms, and clear user feedback

### Integration with Existing Systems

1. **User System**
   - Extend user creation process to create Matrix accounts
   - Update user profile changes to sync with Matrix

2. **Group System**
   - Extend group creation to create Matrix rooms
   - Update group membership changes to update Matrix room membership

3. **Event System**
   - Create Matrix rooms for events with appropriate settings
   - Handle event lifecycle (creation, updates, cancellation) in Matrix

4. **Notification System**
   - Use Matrix to deliver chat notifications
   - Integrate with existing notification preferences

### Monitoring and Operations

1. **Metrics to Track**
   - Message delivery latency
   - Room creation success rate
   - User authentication success rate
   - API response times

2. **Logging Strategy**
   - Log Matrix API interactions for troubleshooting
   - Track error rates and types
   - Monitor user-reported issues

3. **Alerting**
   - Set up alerts for Matrix service disruptions
   - Monitor for unusual patterns in usage or errors
   - Track resource utilization
