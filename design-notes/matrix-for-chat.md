## Implementation Status (September 2025)

The Matrix integration is fully implemented and deployed in production:

- ✅ Matrix Authentication Service (MAS) with OIDC delegation to OpenMeet
- ✅ Client-side Matrix SDK integration (no WebSocket proxy)
- ✅ Application Service bot for room management
- ✅ Real-time messaging via direct Matrix protocol
- ✅ E2E encryption support
- ✅ Automatic room creation for events and groups

## Quick Reference

- Matrix rooms are created automatically when events or groups are created
- Each event and group has a dedicated Matrix room with appropriate permissions
- Matrix user accounts are authenticated via MAS (Matrix Authentication Service)
- Real-time messages are delivered directly via Matrix protocol (client to Matrix server)
- Room identifiers use slugs to ensure uniqueness
- Application Service bot manages room creation and permissions
