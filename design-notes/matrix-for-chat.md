# Matrix Integration for OpenMeet Chat

## User Experience Changes

### Overview
The transition from Zulip to Matrix will be designed to be seamless from the user's perspective, with several notable improvements in functionality and performance. The core chat experience will remain familiar while introducing enhanced features. We'll be removing zulip entirely, and replacing it with matrix. 

### Key User Experience Improvements

## Client Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions

#### User Registration: Admin API vs. Shared Secret

We've chosen to use the Matrix Admin API exclusively for user registration instead of the shared secret registration method.

**Rationale:**
- More secure - doesn't require storing a shared secret in configuration
- Provides better isolation from implementation details of the Matrix server
- Works with any Matrix server implementation, not just Synapse
- Gives us more granular control over user creation
- Simplifies configuration by removing an environment variable

**Implementation:**
- Uses `PUT /_synapse/admin/v2/users/@username:server` endpoint
- Sets password and admin status directly
- Performs standard login to obtain the user's access token and device ID
- No dependency on Synapse-specific registration endpoints

#### Client Instance Management: User-Specific Instances with Lifecycle Management

We've implemented a sophisticated approach for real-time Matrix client management:

**Architecture:**
- Each active user gets a dedicated Matrix client instance
- Admin operations use a separate connection pool
- Clients have automatic lifecycle management

**How it works:**
1. **Client Creation & Start**
   - When a user accesses chat, a dedicated Matrix client is created
   - Client is configured with the user's credentials (userId, accessToken, deviceId)
   - Client starts syncing to receive real-time events
   - Event callbacks are registered for handling messages

2. **Activity Tracking**
   - Each client tracks the last activity timestamp
   - Activity is updated when the user interacts with chat

3. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Inactive clients (no activity for 2 hours) are automatically cleaned up
   - Cleanup runs periodically to prevent resource exhaustion
   - When service is shut down, all clients are properly stopped

4. **Event Handling**
   - Real-time events are delivered through callbacks
   - Multiple callbacks can be registered per client
   - Callbacks can be added/removed dynamically

5. **Message Retrieval**
   - Smart message retrieval that uses synced data when available
   - Falls back to REST API for historical messages
   - Optimized for both real-time and historical data access

### Real-time Updates Implementation

#### Server-Side (NestJS API)

1. **Event Sources**
   - Matrix client instances are maintained for each active user
   - Each Matrix client syncs with the Matrix server in real-time
   - Events are filtered and processed server-side

2. **SSE Endpoint**
   - Endpoint: `/api/matrix/events`
   - Authentication: Uses cookie-based auth to identify the user
   - Response type: `text/event-stream`
   - Implementation: NestJS SSE module with event processing

3. **Event Flow**
   - Matrix client receives events via sync API
   - Events are filtered by type and relevance
   - Events are sent to the browser via SSE
   - Connection cleanup happens automatically when client disconnects

#### Client-Side (Vue.js/Quasar)

1. **Matrix Service**
   - Singleton service to manage Matrix SSE connection
   - Handles connection, error recovery, and event distribution
   - Provides a consistent API for consuming Matrix events

2. **Store Integration**
   - Unified message store handles all real-time message events
   - Single consistent approach for all messaging contexts
   - Store subscribes to Matrix events via the Matrix service

3. **UI Components**
   - MessagesPage displays direct messages with real-time updates
   - DiscussionComponent shows chronological group/event discussions
   - All components use a consistent message display pattern
   - All implement typing indicators and read receipts

#### Event Handling

Events from the server are structured with specific event types:

```
event: m.room.message
data: {"room_id":"!room123:matrix.org","event_id":"$event456",
  "sender":"@user:matrix.org","content":{"body":"Hello world"}}
```

The Matrix service processes these events:

```typescript
eventSource.addEventListener('m.room.message', this.handleRoomMessage.bind(this))
eventSource.addEventListener('m.typing', this.handleTyping.bind(this))
eventSource.addEventListener('m.receipt', this.handleReceipt.bind(this))
```

#### Error Recovery

The implementation includes sophisticated error recovery:

1. **Connection monitoring**
   - Tracks connection status
   - Detects disconnections and errors

2. **Exponential backoff**
   - Progressive delays between reconnection attempts
   - Prevents overwhelming the server during outages

3. **State restoration**
   - Maintains connection state
   - Resumes from last known point after reconnection

### Migration Strategy (Hard Cutover)

1. **Pre-Cutover Preparation**
   - Complete development of Matrix integration
   - Thoroughly test all functionality in staging environment
   - Prepare database migration scripts to add Matrix fields
   - Create admin tools for provisioning Matrix users and rooms

2. **Cutover Process**
   - Schedule maintenance window for the transition
   - Disable access to the platform during cutover
   - Run database migrations to add Matrix-specific fields
   - Provision Matrix users for all existing OpenMeet users
   - Create Matrix rooms for all existing groups and events
   - Deploy updated backend with Matrix integration
   - Deploy updated frontend with Matrix client
   - Enable access to the platform

3. **Post-Cutover Support**
   - Provide clear communication to users about the new chat system
   - Offer documentation on new features
   - Monitor system closely for issues
   - Have support team ready to address user questions
   - Maintain ability to quickly roll back if critical issues arise

4. **Zulip Decommissioning**
   - Once Matrix integration is confirmed stable, decommission Zulip
   - Archive Zulip data for compliance purposes
   - Remove Zulip-related code and dependencies

**Implementation Summary:**
- Implemented hybrid credential management approach for Matrix authentication
- Maintained real-time WebSocket benefits while securing Matrix credentials
- Verified server-side only storage of Matrix credentials
- JWT authentication with secure credential handling

**Key Components:**
1. **Session-based Matrix Client:**
   - Matrix client instance created when WebSocket connection is established
   - Client associated with the user's WebSocket session
   - Client kept in memory only for the duration of the WebSocket connection
   - Client used for all Matrix operations during the session

2. **Server-side Credential Management:**
   - Matrix credentials stored securely in database (encrypted)
   - Credentials retrieved using user ID from JWT authentication
   - No Matrix credentials ever sent to client
   - Proper credential caching to optimize performance

3. **Clean Credential Lifecycle:**
   - When WebSocket connection is established:
     - User authenticated via JWT
     - Matrix credentials retrieved from database
     - Matrix client instance created with these credentials
   - During session:
     - Matrix client used for all operations
     - Tokens refreshed when needed
   - When WebSocket connection closes:
     - Matrix client destroyed
     - Credentials cleared from memory

4. **Multi-tenant Support:**
   - WebSocket connections include tenant ID for proper authentication
   - Tenant ID can be provided through Socket.io auth object, query parameter, or header
   - Tenant ID correctly passed to UserService methods
   - Frontend includes tenant ID in WebSocket connection
   - Default 'default' tenant ID used when no specific tenant provided

**Security Benefits Realized:**
- Matrix credentials never exposed to client
- Credentials only in memory during active session
- No credential transmission over network (beyond initial DB fetch)
- Reduced attack surface

**Performance Benefits Realized:**
- All WebSocket advantages maintained (real-time, low latency)
- Credential lookup avoided on every Matrix operation
- Efficient use of resources with proper cleanup

**Implementation Status:**

- Eliminated direct dependencies between Event and Matrix modules
- Frontend updated to use new slug-based API endpoints
- Moved obsolete EventDiscussionService files to disabled-tests directory
- Fixed Matrix SDK ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues using dynamic imports

**Matrix SDK ESM Compatibility Solution:**
- The Matrix SDK (matrix-js-sdk) uses ES modules, causing compatibility issues with CommonJS in ts-node
- Implemented a dynamic import pattern with placeholder constants to ensure compatibility in all environments
- Initialization happens in onModuleInit using await import() instead of static imports
- This pattern works for ts-node, Jest tests, and production builds without modification

**Implementation Goals:**
- Establish a clean, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Eliminate circular dependencies between modules
- Create clear interfaces for all components to ensure maintainability
- Utilize slug-based methods for all inter-module communication
