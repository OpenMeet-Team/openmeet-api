# Matrix Implementation Phases

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the Matrix chat integration in OpenMeet, along with the current status and pending tasks.

## Implementation Timeline

  - User-specific Matrix clients with automatic cleanup
  - Room creation and management
  - User display name synchronization
  - Real-time updates via server-sent events (SSE)
  - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics
- Fixed issues:
  - Display names now properly use OpenMeet user names instead of Matrix IDs
  - Removed "General" prefix from messages
  - Improved real-time updates

### Phase 1.5: Simplification of Message Model ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Remove thread-based messaging in favor of chronological messaging
- Create unified message store for all chat contexts
- Standardize UI components for messaging

**Achievements:**
- Migrated all messaging UI to unified component architecture
- Fixed inconsistencies between group and event discussion functionality
- Simplified codebase by removing complex topic-based messaging
- Improved real-time performance with WebSocket integration
- Ensured proper user membership in Matrix rooms

### Phase 1.6: Secure Matrix Credential Management ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Server-side Matrix credential management
- WebSocket tenant ID handling
- JWT-only authentication for WebSockets

**Achievements:**
- Implemented server-side Matrix credential storage
- Configured proper tenant ID handling through WebSocket authentication
- Established Matrix client lifecycle management with WebSocket sessions
- Secured WebSocket connection initialization
- Fixed tenant ID passing to UserService.findById()

### Phase 1.9: Service Architecture Restructuring ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Reorganize services to eliminate cross-module dependencies
- Move to event-based communication with slugs

**Achievements:**
- Completed restructuring to eliminate cross-module dependencies
- Moved discussion endpoints from EventController to ChatController
- Implemented event-based communication with slugs instead of IDs
- Eliminated direct dependencies between Event and Matrix modules
- Updated frontend to use new slug-based API endpoints
- Fixed Matrix SDK ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues using dynamic imports

### Phase 2.0: Performance Optimization ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Optimize Matrix chat integration performance
- Reduce database queries and API calls

**Achievements:**
- Implemented request-scoped caching to prevent redundant database queries
- Optimized Matrix room handling to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Improved error handling for "already in room" scenarios
- Added debouncing for typing notifications
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Fixed group membership verification to minimize database operations
- Optimized WebSocket event handling to prevent duplicate processing
- Implemented automatic moderator privileges for appropriate roles

### Phase 2.1-2.3: Improvements and Consolidation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Fix permission and power level issues
- Unify message stores
- Consolidate chat module structure

**Achievements:**
- Fixed power level assignment for event attendees based on roles
- Completed unification of chat-store and unified-message-store
- Consolidated chat-room and chat-service modules into main chat module
- Reorganized directory structure for better code organization
- Resolved circular dependencies with proper use of forwardRef()
- Eliminated redundant ChatRoomModule, integrating it into ChatModule

### Phase 2.4: Credential Management and Error Handling üöß IN PROGRESS

**Key Deliverables:**
- Handle Matrix token errors gracefully
- Preserve existing Matrix User IDs when possible
- Create recovery mechanisms for invalid tokens

**Current Status:**
- Design document completed for credential management approach
- Identified issues with 401 M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN errors
- Created reset plan for local and dev environments

**Pending Tasks:**
1. Implement credential validation and error handling in `matrix-chat-service.adapter.ts`
2. Create database script for resetting Matrix access tokens while preserving user IDs
3. Test credential management approach in local environment
4. Deploy and test in development environment
5. Monitor for authentication failure patterns

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing üöß PLANNED

**Key Deliverables:**
- Automated testing with Cypress
- Manual testing checklist completion
- Performance testing under load

**Testing Status:**
- WebSocket tests implemented but partially skipped until implementation is complete
- Core Matrix service tests passing
- Matrix message tests updated for new service architecture
- Basic WebSocket connection tests passing
- Detailed testing plan created

**Pending Tasks:**
1. Re-enable skipped tests as functionality is completed
2. Implement Cypress tests for Matrix chat features
3. Complete manual testing checklist
4. Perform load testing with multiple concurrent users

### Phase 4: Production Migration and Cutover ‚è≥ UPCOMING

**Key Deliverables:**
- Production-ready Matrix deployment
- Migration strategy for existing users
- Cutover plan with rollback procedures

**Pending Tasks:**
1. Complete comprehensive testing in staging environment
2. Create production deployment plan
3. Develop user migration scripts
4. Schedule maintenance window for cutover
5. Prepare rollback procedures
6. Develop monitoring plan for post-cutover

### Phase 5: Stabilization and Optimization ‚è≥ UPCOMING

**Key Deliverables:**
- Monitor system performance
- Address any issues found in production
- Collect user feedback
- Optimize based on real-world usage

**Pending Tasks:**
1. Implement monitoring for Matrix integration
2. Create feedback mechanism for users
3. Establish response protocol for Matrix-related issues
4. Plan for future enhancements based on usage patterns

## Migration Strategy (Hard Cutover)

1. **Pre-Cutover Preparation**
   - Complete development of Matrix integration
   - Thoroughly test in staging environment
   - Prepare database migration scripts
   - Create admin tools for provisioning

2. **Cutover Process**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Disable access during cutover
   - Run database migrations
   - Provision Matrix users and rooms
   - Deploy updated backend and frontend
   - Enable access to platform

3. **Post-Cutover Support**
   - Provide clear communication to users
   - Monitor system closely
   - Have support team ready
   - Maintain ability to quickly rollback

4. **Zulip Decommissioning**
   - Once stable, decommission Zulip
   - Archive data for compliance
   - Remove Zulip-related code and dependencies
