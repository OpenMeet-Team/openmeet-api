# Matrix Implementation Phases

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Core Service (1 week) ✅ COMPLETED
- Deploy Matrix Synapse server
- Implement basic Matrix service in NestJS
  - Admin API-based user registration (removing dependency on shared registration secret)
  - Resource-efficient client management with user-specific instances
  - Smart message retrieval using synced data when available
  - Automatic cleanup and lifecycle management
- Create user and room mapping system

#### Phase 1 Implementation Notes
- Matrix service implementation complete with the following features:
  - User provisioning via admin API (no shared secret needed)
  - Connection pooling for admin operations
  - User-specific Matrix clients with automatic cleanup
  - Room creation and management
  - User display name management and verification
  - Real-time updates via server-sent events (SSE)
  - Enhanced error handling and diagnostics
- Fixed issues:
  - Display names now properly use OpenMeet user names instead of Matrix IDs
  - Messages no longer show with incorrect "General" prefix
  - Improved real-time updates when new messages arrive

### Phase 1.5: Simplification of Message Model (1 week) ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Status:**

**Completed:**
- ✅ Remove thread relations support from Matrix service
- ✅ Create unified message store to replace chat-store and discussion-store
- ✅ Update API methods to remove topic formatting
- ✅ Update event-discussion service to remove topic handling
- ✅ Create standardized UI components for messaging
- ✅ Implement WebSocket support for real-time messaging
- ✅ Update existing event pages to use the new unified message component
- ✅ Update group discussion pages to use the new unified message component
- ✅ Update direct message pages to use the new unified message component
- ✅ Handle graceful migration of existing threaded discussions
- ✅ Add comprehensive tests for the unified message components
- ✅ Update message type definitions to remove topic-related fields

**Key Achievements:**
- Successfully migrated all messaging UI to the unified component architecture
- Fixed issues with group discussions matching the event discussion functionality
- Ensured consistent user experience across all chat contexts
- Simplified the codebase by removing complex topic-based messaging logic
- Improved real-time performance with WebSocket integration

- Reduced complexity in state management
- Improved real-time responsiveness
- Better developer experience with standardized patterns

### Phase 1.6: Secure Matrix Credential Management ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Server-side Matrix credential management implemented
- ✅ WebSocket tenant ID handling (auth object, query param, headers) configured
- ✅ Matrix client lifecycle management with WebSocket session established
- ✅ JWT-only authentication for WebSockets (no Matrix credentials sent)
- ✅ Secure WebSocket connection initialization verified
- ✅ Backend hotfix: Tenant ID now properly passed to UserService.findById()

### Phase 1.9: Service Architecture Restructuring ✅ COMPLETED

**Current Status:**
- Complete restructuring of services to eliminate cross-module dependencies
- Moved discussion-related endpoints from EventController to ChatController
- Implemented event-based communication with slugs instead of IDs
- Eliminated direct dependencies between Event and Matrix modules
- Frontend updated to use new slug-based API endpoints
- Moved obsolete EventDiscussionService files to disabled-tests directory
- Fixed Matrix SDK ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues using dynamic imports

### Phase 2.0: Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

**Current Status:**
- Implemented comprehensive performance optimizations for Matrix chat integration
- Added request-scoped caching mechanism to prevent redundant database queries
- Optimized Matrix room handling to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Improved error handling for Matrix "already in room" scenarios
- Added debouncing for typing notifications to reduce Matrix API load
- Enhanced logging to reduce verbosity in production while maintaining debuggability
- Fixed group membership verification to minimize database operations
- Optimized WebSocket event handling to prevent duplicate processing
- Implemented automatic moderator privileges for event admins/hosts

### Phase 2.1: Power Level Fixes ✅ COMPLETED (March 2025)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Fixed issue where the first user to attend an event received moderator privileges
- ✅ Improved room permission logic to check for specific roles before granting power levels
- ✅ Added role-based checks for event attendees (checking for Host or Moderator roles)
- ✅ Updated group chat room logic with similar role-based checks
- ✅ Added detailed logging of power level assignment decisions
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing rooms

**Key Fixes:**
- Users now only receive moderator privileges (power level 50) if they have:
  - For events: Host or Moderator role AND ManageEvent permission
  - For groups: Owner, Admin, or Moderator role
- Fixed issue where regular event attendees incorrectly received moderator privileges
- Improved role verification to prevent accidental privilege escalation
- Enhanced error handling to ensure chat functionality works even if permission setting fails
- Added explicit logging to track power level assignments for easier debugging

### Phase 2.2: Message Store Unification ✅ COMPLETED (March 2025)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Completed unification of chat-store and unified-message-store
- ✅ Updated matrixService to use only the unified-message-store
- ✅ Modified typing notification handling to use unified-message-store
- ✅ Added deprecation notice to chat-store
- ✅ Created migration documentation for moving from chat-store to unified-message-store
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility during transition period

**Key Changes:**
- Now using unified-message-store for all message types (direct, group, event)
- Single source of truth for all messaging data
- Consistent API for messaging across all contexts
- Improved deduplication and message handling
- Better type safety and error handling
- Proper separation of direct messages and discussions
- More maintainable codebase with less duplication

**Migration Guide:**
- Replace imports:
  - Before: `import { useChatStore } from '@/stores/chat-store'`
  - After: `import { useMessageStore } from '@/stores/unified-message-store'`
- Function mapping:
  - `chatStore.actionInitializeMatrix()` → `messageStore.initializeMatrix()`
  - `chatStore.actionGetChatList()` → `messageStore.actionGetChatList()`
  - `chatStore.actionSendMessage()` → `messageStore.sendMessage()`
  - `chatStore.chatList` → `messageStore.directChats`
  - `chatStore.activeChat` → `messageStore.activeDirectChat`

### Phase 2.3: Chat Module Consolidation ✅ COMPLETED (March 2025)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ Consolidated chat-room and chat-service modules into the main chat module
- ✅ Reorganized directory structure for better code organization
- ✅ Moved all chat-related services, entities, and interfaces to appropriate locations
- ✅ Updated imports across the codebase to reference new file locations
- ✅ Resolved circular dependencies with proper use of forwardRef()
- ✅ Removed the empty event-discussion directory
- ✅ Eliminated the redundant ChatRoomModule, integrating it into ChatModule

**Key Architectural Changes:**
- Improved code organization with all chat-related functionality in one module
- Clear separation of concerns between interfaces, services, and infrastructure
- Proper interfaces for repository and service abstractions
- Better alignment with Matrix as the future source of truth
