## Current Focus: Credential Management

We are currently focusing on implementing robust credential management to resolve the `M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN` errors encountered in the development environment. The approach preserves existing Matrix user IDs while providing graceful error recovery when Matrix tokens become invalid.

### Key Pending Tasks

1. Implement credential validation and error handling for `M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN` errors
2. Create database script for resetting Matrix access tokens
3. Test the credential management solution in both local and dev environments
4. Deploy the credential management solution to the development environment
5. Complete Cypress testing for Matrix chat features
6. Monitor authentication failure patterns

## Getting Started

For local development with Matrix:

1. Use Docker Compose with the Matrix container:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. Check the Matrix admin token in the logs:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml logs matrix | grep -A 10 "Success! Matrix server initialized"
   ```

3. Update your `.env` file with the Matrix credentials:
   ```
   MATRIX_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_from_logs
   MATRIX_ADMIN_USER=@admin:matrix-local.openmeet.test
   MATRIX_SERVER_NAME=matrix-local.openmeet.test
   MATRIX_HOME_SERVER=http://matrix:8008
   ```
