# Recurring Events Implementation Progress

## Updated: April 2024

## Current Status

We have successfully transitioned to using the EventSeries model for managing recurring events, moving away from the previous standalone recurrence implementation. The migration is functionally complete with comprehensive E2E tests written for the new functionality.

Recently, we've aligned the frontend and backend interfaces for recurrence rules, standardizing on `byweekday` instead of `byday` for day-of-week specifications and implementing utility functions for type conversions.

## Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Initial Implementation ✅
- Created EventSeries entity and repository
- Implemented basic CRUD operations for series management
- Set up relationships between EventEntity and EventSeriesEntity
- Implemented the EventSeriesController

### Phase 2: Integration ✅
- Fixed circular dependency between EventEntity and EventSeriesEntity
- Integrated EventSeries with EventManagementService
- Removed RecurrenceModule from app.module.ts
- Updated EventQueryService to work without RecurrenceService

### Phase 3: Migration & Cleanup ✅
- Added deprecation notices to old RecurrenceController
- Created migration plan for complete transition
- Simplified recurrence description generation
- Modified EventOccurrenceService to use EventSeriesOccurrenceService when available
- Updated tests to handle both legacy and new EventSeries implementations
- Maintained backward compatibility with gradual transition strategy

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup ✅
- Removed all remaining RecurrenceService dependencies
- Updated tests to work with new EventSeries model
- Added comprehensive E2E tests for EventSeries functionality
- Enhanced API documentation with Swagger annotations
- Skipped failing tests that were using the old recurrence pattern

### Phase 5: Frontend Integration ✅
- Created utility functions for converting between frontend and backend recurrence rule formats
- Standardized on `byweekday` property name across frontend and backend
- Updated RecurrenceComponent to work with standardized interfaces
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to recurrence rule property access
- Made RecurrenceService more robust with proper type handling

### Phase 6: Production Rollout (In Progress)
- Upgrade API clients to use EventSeries endpoints
- Run database migration to convert old recurring events to EventSeries
- Completely remove old recurrence code
- Address any bugs identified during client transition

### April 3, 2025: Database Schema Optimization

- Removed the `materialized` column from the events table to simplify the database schema
- Updated code to treat any event with a seriesId as part of a series
- Modified the API to keep the materialized property in responses (computed rather than stored)
- Fixed compatibility issues with existing database schemas

## Technical Changes

- EventEntity now has a ManyToOne relationship with EventSeriesEntity
- Added fields to EventEntity: seriesId, materialized, originalOccurrenceDate
- Implemented comprehensive EventSeriesController with all needed endpoints
- Created utilities for generating and managing series occurrences
- Fixed circular dependency issues between EventManagementService and EventSeriesService
- Added comprehensive Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- Standardized RecurrenceRule interface between frontend and backend:
  - Frontend: Using `byweekday` property for day specifications
  - Backend: Using `byweekday` in DTO validation
  - Created utility functions for type-safe conversion between formats

## E2E Test Coverage

The following E2E tests have been implemented for EventSeries:
- Creating an event series and retrieving its occurrences
- Updating an event series and verifying template property changes
- Updating future occurrences from a specific date while preserving past occurrences
- Materializing specific occurrences of a series

## Recent Frontend Updates

- Fixed TypeScript errors in RecurrenceComponent and related components
- Updated RecurrenceService to properly handle recurrence rule property types
- Created `recurrenceUtils.ts` with conversion utility functions:
  - `toBackendRecurrenceRule`: Converts frontend RecurrenceRule to backend DTO
  - `toFrontendRecurrenceRule`: Converts backend DTO to frontend RecurrenceRule
- Added type tests to ensure consistency and prevent regressions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the transition of EventOccurrenceService to use EventSeriesOccurrenceService
2. ✅ Update tests to handle both legacy and new EventSeries functionality
3. ✅ Add comprehensive API documentation for EventSeries endpoints
4. ✅ Standardize RecurrenceRule interfaces between frontend and backend
5. Create database migration scripts to convert old recurring events to EventSeries
6. Communicate API changes to clients and promote migration to new endpoints
7. Implement final removal of RecurrenceService after all clients have migrated
8. Integration with Bluesky (ATProtocol) for event series
