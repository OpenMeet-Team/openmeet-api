# Recurring Events Implementation Progress

## Completed

1. **Event Series Database Schema and Entity**
   - Created EventSeries table with fields for recurrence rules, timeZone, etc.
   - Added seriesId, materialized, and originalOccurrenceDate to Event table
   - Set up appropriate foreign keys and indexes
   - Kept existing recurrence fields for backward compatibility

2. **EventSeries Core Implementation**
   - Created EventSeriesEntity and TypeORM repository
   - Implemented EventSeriesService for CRUD operations
   - Developed EventSeriesOccurrenceService for materializing occurrences
   - Created EventSeriesController with RESTful endpoints
   - Added DTOs for creating, updating, and returning series

3. **Occurrence Materialization Model**
   - Implemented hybrid approach where events are materialized when:
     - A user with leadership role edits a specific occurrence
     - Users attend or start a discussion on an occurrence
     - The current next event is completed
   - Events remain as "templates" until materialized
   - Changes to the series template affect all future unmaterialized occurrences

4. **Design Documentation**
   - Documented the approach in event-series-implementation.md
   - Outlined URL structure and materialization rules
   - Defined ATProtocol integration strategy

5. **EventSeries Integration with Event Management**
   - Enhanced EventManagementService to work with EventSeries
   - Added methods for:
     - Creating events as part of a series (createSeriesOccurrenceBySlug)
     - Finding all events in a series (findEventsBySeriesSlug)
     - Updating events that are part of a series (updateSeriesOccurrence)
   - Fixed circular dependency issues between EventEntity and EventSeriesEntity
   - Prioritized slug-based methods for user-facing code over internal ID-based methods
   - Added unit tests for EventSeries integration features

6. **Code Quality and Testing**
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in EventSeries repository implementation
   - Added thorough documentation with JSDoc comments
   - Created unit tests for EventSeriesService and integration with EventManagementService
   - Marked ID-based methods as internal and encouraged use of slug-based methods

## Current Work in Progress

1. **EventSeries Service Completion**
   - Continued development of EventSeriesOccurrenceService
   - Added helper methods for integration with other services
   - Improved error handling and edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Updates**
   - Enhance RecurrenceComponent.vue to work with EventSeries
   - Update API clients to use new EventSeries endpoints
   - Implement Quasar calendar integration for series visualization
   - Create UI components for series management

3. **ATProtocol Integration**
   - Implement strategies for syncing recurring events with Bluesky
   - Create a job to populate occurrences 2 months into the future
   - Add heuristics to detect potential series from individual events

4. **Additional Features**
   - Implement following/attendance for series vs. specific occurrences
   - Add Matrix chat room integration for series
   - Create iCalendar export for series

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write unit tests for EventSeries services
   - Create end-to-end tests for the series lifecycle
   - Validate timezone handling across DST boundaries

## Open Questions

1. **Migration Strategy**
   - How to migrate existing recurring events to the new model?
   - Should we preserve all existing occurrences or regenerate them?

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - How do we handle long-running series (multiple years) efficiently?
   - What caching strategies should we implement?

3. **Edge Cases**
   - How to handle modifications to a series that has already had some occurrences?
   - What happens when an occurrence is cancelled or rescheduled?
