# Unified Recurring Events Implementation

## Status Update (April 2025)

We have successfully migrated to the EventSeries model for handling recurring events, replacing the old recurrence implementation. This document outlines the current state and next steps.

## Current Implementation

The EventSeries implementation provides:
- Complete CRUD operations for managing series of events
- Proper timezone support
- Support for BlueS`ky ATProtocol integration
- Compatible with iCalendar standards
- More maintainable entity relationships

## Completed Changes

- ✅ Implemented EventSeries entity and related functionality
- ✅ Created EventSeriesController with comprehensive endpoints
- ✅ Removed RecurrenceModule from app.module.ts
- ✅ Updated EventQueryService to not depend on RecurrenceService
- ✅ Added deprecation notices to the old RecurrenceController
- ✅ Modified EventOccurrenceService to use EventSeriesOccurrenceService
- ✅ Updated tests to support both legacy and new implementations
- ✅ Implemented backward compatibility to ensure smooth transition

## Remaining Tasks

- Create database migration scripts to convert old recurring events to EventSeries
- Communicate API changes to clients and guide migration to new endpoints
- Complete documentation for the EventSeries API
- Plan for complete removal of RecurrenceService after client migration
- Eventually remove the old recurrence code entirely

## Implementation Notes

### EventSeries Design

The EventSeries model provides a more flexible and maintainable way to handle recurring events:

1. **Entity Relationships**:
   - EventSeriesEntity contains the recurrence pattern
   - EventEntity can belong to a series with a seriesId reference

2. **Occurrence Handling**:
   - Virtual occurrences are generated on-demand
   - Materialized occurrences are stored as regular events with a series reference
   - Modified occurrences have the materialized flag and originalOccurrenceDate

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - CRUD operations for series management
   - Occurrence management (materialization, modification)
   - Future occurrences generation

### Transition Strategy

The transition from the old recurrence implementation to EventSeries follows a careful strategy:

1. **Compatibility Layer**:
   - EventOccurrenceService has been updated to check for seriesId and use EventSeriesOccurrenceService when available
   - Legacy code paths still work for backward compatibility
   - Core services maintain dual functionality during the transition

2. **Deprecation Notices**:
   - Deprecation notices added to the RecurrenceController
   - JSDocs updated with @deprecated tags and migration guidance
   - Documentation updated to guide users to new endpoints

3. **Phased Removal**:
   - Stage 1: ✅ Deprecate and add compatibility layer (current state)
   - Stage 2: Database migration to convert legacy events to use EventSeries
   - Stage 3: Client migration period with both APIs available
   - Stage 4: Complete removal of RecurrenceService after clients have migrated

## Benefits

- Better separation of concerns
- More maintainable code structure
- Improved performance for occurrence handling
- Full timezone support
- Better standardization with iCalendar
- Improved support for third-party integrations
