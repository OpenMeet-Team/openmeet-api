# Billing System

This system is responsible for managing customer subscriptions, and billing. It ties into the Usage Limits system to ensure customers do not exceed the limits they pay for.

Customers start on a free plan. Once they use their credits, they can upgrade to a paid plan, or pay as they go.

If there are credits on the account beyond the free tier, they can be donated to others in the form of rewards or "buy me a coffee" credits.

## Goals

We have a successful system if:

- Customers are able to pay for an account.
- Customers are able to see their usage and costs.
- Customers are able to upgrade and downgrade their account.
- Customers have activity halted after exceeding their limit and are encouraged to upgrade.
- Taxes are calculated and collected correctly if we need to collect taxes.
- Credits can be rewarded to other users for "buy me a coffee" or other rewards.

## Features

- Subscription management, pay as you go, monthly, yearly
- Payment processing
- Tax collection
- Rewards for credits
- Leverages usage tracking/limits system

## Implementation

- We will use Stripe for payment processing.
- We will use Stripe Tax for tax collection?

### Security Considerations

- Validate Stripe webhook signatures
- Encrypt sensitive payment data
- Never store raw credit card information
- Implement audit logging for all billing operations
- Follow PCI compliance guidelines
- Use `pk_test_*` and `sk_test_*` keys for development
- Never commit secret keys (`sk_*`) to version control
- Set up webhook signing secrets per environment

### Monitoring

- Track key metrics:
  - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
  - Customer churn rate
  - Payment failure rates
  - Credit usage patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns
