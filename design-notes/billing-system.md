# System Design Document: Stripe Billing System

## Overview
A comprehensive billing system using Stripe to handle one-off payments and subscription-based pricing models (monthly/yearly). 
The system will manage user subscriptions, credits, and payment processing while ensuring security and compliance.

## Business Context

- Need for flexible payment options to monetize the platform
- Support for both subscription and pay-as-you-go models
- Provide users with self-service billing management
- Generate predictable recurring revenue

## Goals & Success Metrics

- Customers able to pay for monthly/yearly subscriptions
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth
- Payment success rate > 95%

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Support for one-off payments
- Monthly and yearly subscription options
- Credit system for pay-as-you-go features
- Self-service customer portal
- Automated billing notifications
- Usage tracking and reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements

- 99.9% payment processing uptime
- 5s payment processing time
- PCI compliance
- Scalable to handle 10,000+ subscribers

## Technical Design

### Stripe Integration

1. **Products & Prices Setup**

- Define products in Stripe dashboard
  - Free tier (price: $0)
  - Mid-tier (monthly/yearly options)
  - High-tier (monthly/yearly options)
  - Pay-as-you-go credits (one-off purchases)

2. **Subscription Handling**

- Use Stripe Customer objects to track users
- Implement Stripe Checkout for simple payment flow
- Use Stripe Customer Portal for self-service management
  - Allows users to manage payment methods
  - Handle subscription upgrades/downgrades
  - View billing history

4. **Webhooks Implementation**

- Handle essential events:
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.paid`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`
  - `checkout.session.completed`
- possibly handle:
  - `payment_intent.succeeded`
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
  - `customer.updated`
  - `customer.deleted`
  - `charge.succeeded`
  - `charge.failed`
  - `charge.refunded`

5. **Credit System**

- Track credits in local database
- Implement credit purchase through Stripe one-off payments
- Enable credit transfers between users
- Automatic credit allocation from subscriptions
- How do we handle payments to customers if they want to cash out their credits?

### Security Considerations

- Validate Stripe webhook signatures
- Encrypt sensitive payment data
- Never store raw credit card information
- Implement audit logging for all billing operations
- Follow PCI compliance guidelines
- Use `pk_test_*` and `sk_test_*` keys for development
- Never commit secret keys (`sk_*`) to version control
- Set up webhook signing secrets per environment

### Monitoring the system

- Track key metrics:
  - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
  - Customer churn rate
  - Payment failure rates
  - Credit usage patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns
- Monitor webhook delivery and processing

### Security & Compliance

- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Encrypted payment data
- PCI compliance measures
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting on payment endpoints

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for billing logic
- Integration tests with Stripe API
- Load testing for payment endpoints
- Security penetration testing
- Webhook reliability testing

## Deployment Strategy

- Environment-specific Stripe keys
- Database migration strategy must be smooth and reliable
